# Data 200 Grad Project

Make sure to 'git pull' before you start working!

# Known setup issues
- [ ] Need to find a way to get large files / datasets, as git only supports up to 100mb without GitLFS. Will likely use [gdown](https://github.com/wkentaro/gdown).

# Setup
1. Clone the reop to your local machine. For example, if using command line:
    - git clone https://github.com/gavintchan/data200-grad-project.git
